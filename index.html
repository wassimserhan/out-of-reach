  <p>Out of Reach is a memoir by Palestinian American author Layla Noor who was born in Gaza in 1946 during the height
    of
    conflict in Palestine. She wanted to chase a dream of success and love and this journey took her to many exotic
    locations around the world. Layla’s tale chronicles her life from near death, war time experiences and multiple
    heartbreaks, to the strength and resilience which would see her succeed in the face of adversity.<br><br> Out of
    Reach reveals
    her dramatic love story with a Jewish American man in an unlikely relationship that symbolizes the surprising
    situation
    in which strong love can be found. Layla’s positive attitude and unwillingness to give up serve as an inspiration
    to
    readers and a testament to people’s ability to look past their differences and origin. A compelling story of an
    outgoing, independent Middle Eastern woman who lives life to the fullest and has learned the harsh lessons of her
    life
    through, romance, loss, and deceit.

    <div class="testimonial bg-dark">
    
      <p>What an INCREDIBLE true life story of life's and love's experiences! Intriguing depictions from child to adulthood,
      religious and cultural differences, parental and sibling relationships and those of lover, wife and mother, Layla Noor
      is nothing shy of phenomenal! I have gifted both male and females with this book to hear reactions that mirror my
      own--I just could not quit reading! - J. L. Ward</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="testimonial bg-dark">
    
      <p>An inspiring story I didn't want to put down. A blend of history, international travel, a romance novel, all rolled
      into one and an insight into different cultures that can come together in love and heartbreak. It shows us all there is
      always hope, even in the bleakest of times, and we can overcome life's difficult times if we just believe in
      ourselves..
      
      Layla seems to be a very strong and independent woman who knows what she wants, I wish her luck in her future
      endeavours and relationships. - K. Marder</p>
