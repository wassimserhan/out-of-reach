					<p>
						Out of Reach is a memoir by Palestinian American author Layla Noor
						who was born in Palestine during the height of conflict. She wanted
						to chase a dream of success and love and this journey took her to
						many exotic locations around the world. Layla’s tale chronicles her
						life from near death, war time experiences and multiple heartbreaks,
						to the strength and resilience which would see her succeed in the
						face of adversity.<br /><br />
						Out of Reach reveals her dramatic love story with a Jewish American
						man in an unlikely relationship that symbolizes the surprising
						situation in which strong love can be found. Layla’s positive
						attitude and unwillingness to give up serve as an inspiration to
						readers and a testament to people’s ability to look past their
						differences and origin. A compelling story of an outgoing,
						independent Middle Eastern woman who lives life to the fullest and
						has learned the harsh lessons of her life through, romance, loss,
						and deceit.

						What an INCREDIBLE true life story of life's and love's experiences!
						Intriguing depictions from child to adulthood, religious and
						cultural differences, parental and sibling relationships and those
						of lover, wife and mother, Layla Noor is nothing shy of phenomenal!
						I have gifted both male and females with this book to hear reactions
						that mirror my own--I just could not quit reading! -

						An inspiring story I didn't want to put down. A blend of history,
						international travel, a romance novel, all rolled into one and an
						insight into different cultures that can come together in love and
						heartbreak. It shows us all there is always hope, even in the
						bleakest of times, and we can overcome life's difficult times if we
						just believe in ourselves. Layla seems to be a very strong and
						independent woman who knows what she wants, I wish her luck in her
						future endeavours and relationships. - <strong>K. Marder</strong>
